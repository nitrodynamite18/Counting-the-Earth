# Counting-the-Earth

This is a dumb bit of code that I wrote after showing my parents how to count in binary on your fingers. I wondered how many atoms there are on planet Earth (roughly 133,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 if you were curious) and just how many friends you would need to count that amount (17, using 167 fingers on 34 hands). I could find no answer online so I wrote this code to calculate it.
